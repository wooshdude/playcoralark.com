                                <p>A roar, followed by a hot blast of fire, raced across the battlefield. Spoget raised his shield to block the attack, as JD dodged to the side. Both were obviously worn out, beads of sweat visible on the parts of their face not covered by sturdy netherite.</p>
                                <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost out of potions. You?&rdquo; JD asked Spoget, panting as he did.</p>
                                <p>&ldquo;No potions over here, and it feels like my sword is about to give out at any swing&rdquo;.</p>
                                <p>&ldquo;Then we need to end this&rdquo;. JD raised his giant emerald blade and raced towards the beast, which retaliated by spewing another stream of flames. JD smashed a vile of orange liquid onto the floor, splashing himself with the contents. Without hesitating, he plunged himself into the spread. The heat from the dragon&rsquo;s breath seemed to have no effect on the warrior as he kept barreling straight, finally getting close enough to stab his sword through the reptiles lower jaw. Immediately, the dragon threw JD to the side.</p>
                                <p>&ldquo;What are you thinking!?&rdquo; Spoget shouted, but quickly changed tone when he realized what had happened. With the sword lodged in the dragons mouth, it could no longer use its flames, lest it risk burning its own exposed flesh. This was the moment. Spoget broke into a sprint towards the creature. With a firework in hand, he jammed his fist into the dragon&rsquo;s throat and lit the rocket. After he too was knocked away, the dragon&rsquo;s neck erupted, blowing a hole in its throat. It lay on the floor, defeated and barely breathing. JD approached for the last time. Slowly, he retrieved his sword, only to plunge it into the dragons skull, finishing the beast once and for all.</p>
                                <p>The last remaining Nether Dragon was defeated.</p>                            </div>
