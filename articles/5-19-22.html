<p>This week at Coralark, many people have returned.</p>
<p>After months of distractions, the residents of Coralark have mostly all come back to continue their projects. This has laid the foundation for one of the most productive weeks in the server&rsquo;s history, so let's catch everyone up on what has been built.</p>
<br>
<h2>Mall&rsquo;n Out</h2>
<h3>Animal Farm</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dude Pharmaceuticals has successfully drained an Ocean Monument! Expect a fully functioning farm and shop soon.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h3>Emerald Town</h3>
<ul>
<li>A hot air balloon has floated up next to the giant floating island. In a perfect world, the balloon should be farming gunpowder, but unfortunately there are no signs of creeper activity.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h3>Section 8</h3>
<ul>
<li>Many new buildings have popped up in the residential district as well as more progress on the zoo.</li>
<li>The Super Smelter has been completed! Feel free to use it at anytime as long as you only take what you smelted and please occasionally donate coal to make up for what you&rsquo;ve used.</li>
<li>The foundation for the casino has been laid down.</li>
<li>The large building near spawn now has a working elevator.</li>
<li>The mall has received a much needed touch up. Proper lights and a plethora of plant life have been added to the interior to spice up the mall&rsquo;s overall vibe. Additionally, the Ikea and Library have been closed up to minimize confusion and two new shops have opened. One selling iron and sugar cane and one selling wood. The bottom floor is nearly full of shops, so expect the mall to gain some verticality soon.</li>
<ul>
<li>If you are interested in opening a new shop in the mall, contact GuyInABush.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>Just as swiftly as it had been constructed, the Thrift Store has unfortunately been laid to rubble. A new design is expected to take its place soon.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Babel</h3>
<ul>
<li>A long ice-path has been drawn in the nether. Once it&rsquo;s been spawn proofed, players should have an easier, but still lengthy, time getting to Babel.</li>
</ul>
<center><img src="../images/long_ice_path.png"  class='screenshot'></center>
<br>
<h3>Deedoism</h3>
<ul>
<li>Castle Deed has seen some action this week. The support towers have been raised, making the whole structure look much more fortified.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<br>
<h3>Creative World Projects</h3>
<ul>
<li>JellyCo&rsquo;s epic 1.18 base has been finished! Soon we&rsquo;ll be able to see this monster start being constructed in the survival world. Once they pick a spot to build, that is.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technical Changes</h2>
<p>A lot of resources went into further customizing the server&rsquo;s resource pack this week, and it&rsquo;s pretty cool.</p>
<h3>It&rsquo;s a sword, it&rsquo;s a spear, it&rsquo;s a- shoe?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added the custom textures to the game.</li>
<ul>
<li>Players can now change their item&rsquo;s textures by changing the item&rsquo;s lore.</li>
<li>Use /setloreline &lt;line&gt; &lt;text&gt; to add lore to an item.</li>
<center><img src="../images/custom_textures.png"  class='screenshot'></center>
<ul>
<li>Players can submit custom designs to a server admin to get them added to the custom resource pack.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<br>
<hr class="three">
<br>

<p>A lot of things have been happening everywhere, as well as some really cool new add-ons to play with. This week has been pretty great.</p>
<p>The server has gained a lot of momentum the past seven days, let's keep it up.</p>
