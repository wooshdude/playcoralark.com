<p>This week at Coralark, we prepare to uncover the mystery of the wild.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost here, folks. Minecraft 1.19: The Wild Update is right around the corner. Come June 7th, we&rsquo;re going to get to explore its new changes. Let&rsquo;s get into what new features will be brought to Coralark, as well as what&rsquo;s happened on the server since the last TWAC!</p>
<br>
<h2>Not Enough Farms</h2>
<p>This week hasn&rsquo;t been the busiest week in the servers history (you have Destiny 2 to thank for that), but there have still been a few notable things to share.</p>
<br>
<h3>Animal Farm</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Ocean Monument near the Dude Pharmaceuticals island has been transformed into a guardian farm.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h3>Emerald Town</h3>
<ul>
<li>An old development that we forgot to include last TWAC is the stained glass river in Emerald Town. Squid can&rsquo;t spawn in glass, and it looks fantastic!</li>
</ul>
<center><img src="../images/glass_river.png"  class='screenshot'></center>
<br>
<h3>Babel</h3>
<ul>
<li>Some new hobbit-hole-like hobbit holes have appeared on the side of a hill.</li>
</ul>
<center><img src="../images/hobbit_holes.png"  class='screenshot'></center>
<br>
<h3>Unknown land</h3>
<ul>
<li>An oak cabin mansion stirs to life, only to settle once more.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<hr class="two">
<br>
<h2>Alright, what&rsquo;s so Wild?</h2>
<p>Here we go, the Wild Update, what&rsquo;s so special about it? The Wild Update plans to add two main new features: mangrove swamps, and the Deep Dark. Mangrove swamps are a new biome the can be discovered in the world and will have new resources like mangrove trees and mud, a new way to make renewable clay farms. </p>
<center><img src="../images/deep_dark2.png"  class='screenshot'></center>
<p>The Deep Dark is arguably much more exciting than that, however. Deep underground, but not quite past the bedrock, you can find an Ancient City, a deprecated and ruinous landscape that has been overrun by skulk. In these cities you can discover very powerful new loot, but watch out; one wrong step and you might find yourself in a world of trouble&hellip;</p>
<br>
<hr class="three">
<br>
<p>Man, I hope you&rsquo;re all excited to start diving into those ancient cities. I hear they&rsquo;re quite the challenge, but I have faith that you can pull off the heist! Anyway, that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got for you this week. See you on Tuesday!</p>
<p>Glowing regards</p>
