                <h2>RESSURECTION</h2>
                <p style="color: #555;">-Pringle</p>
                <br>
                <p>This week at Coralark, we&rsquo;re excited!</p>
<p>Wow! It&rsquo;s been <em>half a year</em> since we last brought you a TWAC. I&rsquo;ve got to say, I really miss these little blogs. It was always such a joy to advertise the cool things you&rsquo;ve all been making on the server, and I&rsquo;m so happy to be able to continue.</p>
<p>With that sappy intro out of the way, let&rsquo;s see what has been happening on Coralark!</p>
<br>
<h2>Developments Galore</h2>
<p>Unsuprisingly, many ambitious projects that were left halfway have been resumed, and several new projects have popped up. Here&rsquo;s a little glimpse into what&rsquo;s been going on.</p>
<h3>Animal Farm</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Ocean Monument near the Dude Pharmaceuticals island is being drained and transformed into a guardian farm. Soon, players will be able to buy prismarine and sea lanterns from Shop Shop. It will also serve as a new way to grind for EXP points to repair your gear.</li>
<li>Speaking of Shop Shop, Dude Pharmaceuticals has also put together a raid farm. They always say the best way to cheat death is to simply not die, and with this many totems of undying, that&rsquo;s sure to be a non-issue.</li>
<li>A dripleaf arena has appeared outside of Section 8! Players can finally compete for glory in Coralarks safest arena to date.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h3>Emerald Town</h3>
<ul>
<li>The large building hovering above Emerald Town is nearing completion. Several new layers have been built, as well as a large floating platform to support the structure. Needless to say, it&rsquo;s coming along nicely and we can&rsquo;t wait to see it&rsquo;s final form.</li>
</ul>
<center><img src="../images/mj big house.png"  class='screenshot'></center>
<br>
<h3>Babel</h3>
<ul>
<li>A new town has appeared and has planted their flag in the far north-west. They&rsquo;ve just begun establishing their infrastructure, but the doors are wide open for this ambitious new town!</li>
</ul>
<center><img src="../images/babel portal.png"  class='screenshot'></center>
<br>
<h3>Water</h3>
<ul>
<li>In one last hurrah, Water has constructed possibly the ugliest base the server has ever seen, before promptly disbanding. You can find the final remnants of this now-time-lost town in the Section 8 Mall.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<br>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also had some cool developments in our creative world, too! The creative world is a super flat world that all players have access to. You can use it to plan out your builds, or simply to have fun!</p>
<br>
<h3>Creative World Projects</h3>
<h4>Jelly Co</h4>
<ul>
<li>Not satisfied with its old plans, Jelly Co has begun to completely redesign its 1.18 base. So far, the build looks spectacular and we can&rsquo;t wait to see it appear in the survival world!</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h2>Woah, That's a Lot of Wires</h2>
<p>As always, the player support team has made some changes to the server. Here are their updates:</p>
<h3>Survival &amp; Creative</h3>
<ul>
<li>The functionality of the /mvtp command has been changed. It will still take you to the world you want, but it will remember your last known position in each world. This way, when you decide to head back to either world, you will be placed in the same spot you left. No more being sent directly to spawn.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Towny</h3>
<ul>
<li>All towns have had explosions turned off.</li>
<li>All towns now have PVP enabled.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are subject to change in the future, so watch out for updates in future TWACS!</p>
<h3>Everything else</h3>
<ul>
<li>Several plugins were updated recently.</li>
<ul>
<li>Image on Maps was updated to a beta version. Players will have full access to all of its features, but there may be some unexpected bugs.</li>
<li>Dragon Drop Elytra has been disabled for a while without any notice. If you&rsquo;ve been farming the dragon for some wings and wondered why it was so dry, this is why.</li>
<li>Geyser and Floodgate are now working again. You can once again join the server from any device you wish.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>The official playcoralark.com website home page has also had a fresh makeover. Take a minute to check it out and learn where all those pesky buttons have run off to.</p>
<br>
<hr class="three">
<br>
<p>Phew! What a meaty TWAC! I guess that&rsquo;s what happens when you leave talented players alone for a few weeks. As always, if you&rsquo;d like to invite your friends to our server, feel free to do so! Our world has so much history, and I can&rsquo;t wait to see what happens next. While I can&rsquo;t tell the future, I hear there&rsquo;s a rumor that the Section 8 Casino might finally be built&hellip;</p>
<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got for you this week! Now go and play some Dripleaf Spleef!</p>
<p>Glowing regards</p>
<p>-Pringle</p>
