                <br>

                <p>This week at Your Mom SMP, everyone is hard at work on new projects.</p>
                <p>Last week you all responded positively to our new layout, so we&rsquo;re keeping it!</p>
                <p>Now on with the news.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Where did that Mountain go?</h2>
                <p>There are only a handful of completed projects to report on this week because most of the current builds are so big that it will take a few weeks for each to finish! Here is an update on all those big projects and a few things that were completed.</p>
                <center><img src="../images/mountain.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 20px; max-width: 800px; border-radius: 10px;"></center>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Section 8</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li>The area around the lighthouse has been transformed into a beach! While it is mostly done, expect more beach-themed decorations in the future</li>
                <li>3 shops have been added to the mall:</li>
                <ul>
                <li>Fight or Flight: This red, orange, and yellow building from Wooshco sells fireworks and elytra, the perfect pair to allow players to touch the clouds (Reminder: Wooshco gunpowder pass owners get a 50% discount on all firework purchases)</li>
                <li>Dyes o&rsquo; Plenty: This modern looking store sells a handful of dyes for all of your recoloring needs. Expect a wider variety of dyes soon</li>
                <li>The End-Times: If you have not noticed the giant shulker box and end towers in the middle of the mall, you must have been on vacation. This store sells shulker boxes, what else would you expect?</li>
                </ul>
                <li>The main path has been extended. It now connects to the mayor&rsquo;s house, the beach, a new cemetery, and the bullet train</li>
                <li>A super smelter is being constructed across from the train station</li>
                <li>The giant mountain next to spawn has been almost completely mined out to make space for new projects. More on this in a later section</li>
                <li>In the residential district, the center of town has gotten a remodel, two new streets have been paved, and the Zoo continues to develop</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Animal Farm</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li>A blackstone base has been erected on a mushroom island far South of Animal Farm, I hope nothing illegal is happening there...</li>
                <li>While not an official part of Animal Farm, the chunk completely dug out by one of its residents has been turned into a sparring ground. Guests can come enjoy drinks and seating as they watch competitors hit each other into a bottomless pit... sounds like fun!</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Jellyco</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li>The train track between Emerald Town and Section 8 is nearing completion</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Sandwich.co</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li>An island Southwest of Section 8 has been claimed to begin construction of Castle Deed&nbsp;</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>This Title is Creative</h2>
                <p>As the server grows, our future plans do too. And as our plans grow, testing them out becomes harder and harder in a survival world. That&rsquo;s why a superflat creative testing world has been added as an extension of the server.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Players who wish to teleport to the creative world should use the command</p>
                <p><strong>mv tp creative</strong></p>
                <p>Players who wish to then return to the survival world should use the command</p>
                <p><strong>mv tp world</strong></p>
                <p>We ask that when in the creative world, you build far enough from other&rsquo;s creations and do not alter their creations in any way.</p>
                <p>I for one am super excited to see what people start building when they have no limitations. A few people have been using this world already to design something that will be filling the gap left by the excavated mountain in Section 8. Here&rsquo;s a teaser of what they have built so far. If you are that interested, feel free to see it for yourself in the creative world!</p>

                <h2>Hacking away all Day</h2>
                <p>Now we welcome the player support team to give important information on the many changes to the server on the technical side this week.</p>
                <p>This is their report.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Updates</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li>Added new creative world for players to test their builds, or just to have fun.</li>
                <ul>
                <li>Players will have unique inventories per-world, so you don&rsquo;t need to worry about storing your gear before going to either world.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Nether portal search radius was changed from 128 blocks to 16.</li>
                <li>Updated GSit.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Potential Bugs</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li>Ender chests may be messed up for players who visited the creative world before this TWAYM releases. If this is the case, please contact wooshdude to have this issue resolved.</li>
                <li>Some players may not be able to travel through nether portals. We are looking into this.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Next week, we may see the start of us switching authors around. I might not be with you next thursday. But don&rsquo;t worry I&rsquo;ll be leaving you in safe hands. Until then, I need to figure out where the heck I am going to put all the terracotta from that mountain.</p>
                <p>See you in my storage bunker,</p>
